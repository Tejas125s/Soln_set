1. sierpinski triangle: Chaos game simulated for 2000 iterations
AGM: Generated a 3d plot of agm values in range, lower limit and upper limit are mentioned in the screenshot uploaded.
Collatz conjecture: Plots of ranges has been made, and a histogram has been plotted
A seperate Python file has been made for fractals in a square with some additional condition added to the same code.
Gray code: Gray code has been obtained, but I coudnt understand the problem statement so could not proceed further
KNN classifier: I have started on this task, but due to time constraint I havent been able to finish this within the deadline, I will try to finish this as soon as possible and upload it to the same repository.
